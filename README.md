# The project

For project 4, I didn't want to bite off more than I could chew. I wanted to focus on what I knew how to do and doing it well. I also wanted to have the chance to flex my front-end development skills. So, I built a fully front-end application. I hae always struggled with styling and layering and so my focus on this project was rendering a website that I could be proud of.

For me, this was a business contract. My father owns a landscaping business, and wanted an online presence. I sat down with him over christmas break and asked him: what did he want in a website? I got all his requirements down and started working on something he could use: sleek, easy to read and interact with, and simple.

The URL is deployed (provided at top) but to run this project, you can clone and run `npm install`, and then `npm run start` to start the local server. The entire project is written in React.


# User stories

My users are straightforward: my father, who represents a lot of his own clientele: older, no real presence on the internet, limited technical capability. I wanted the website to look nice, to read well, and to be easy to interact with. For younger folks, the website is straightforward, with a subdued color palette to reflect that MJM Landscaping (my father's business) is a serious, no-fooling-around business committed to the work it does. 

# Unsolved problems

I eventually want to fully flesh this out and build a back-end; right now, the interest form is linked through Google forms. I had trouble figuring out exactly how to make the database interactable (i.e. at least send alerts when an interest form is submitted, so my father can respond to inquiries.) That's something I think will take a little more finagling, but I look forward to the challenge in the future.
